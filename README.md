**Project Description: Car Rental System in Java**

This Java project implements a simple Car Rental System, allowing users to rent and return cars. The system consists of three main classes: `Car`, `Customer`, and `Rental`, encapsulating the properties and behaviors of cars, customers, and rentals, respectively. The core functionality is managed by the `CarRentalSystem` class, which acts as the system controller.

**Key Features:**

1. **Object-Oriented Design:**
   - Utilizes classes and objects to model real-world entities such as cars and customers.
   - Encapsulation is employed to hide the internal details of classes, promoting code modularity.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Maintains three lists (`cars`, `customers`, and `rentals`) to store information about available cars, registered customers, and active rentals.

3. **Renting and Returning Cars:**
   - Allows customers to rent available cars for a specified number of days.
   - Supports the return of rented cars, updating their availability status.

4. **Customer and Rental Management:**
   - Creates and stores customer information, including a unique customer ID.
   - Manages rental transactions, associating rented cars with customers and tracking rental duration.

5. **User Interaction via Console Menu:**
   - Implements a console-based menu system for user interaction.
   - Users can choose to rent a car, return a car, or exit the system.

6. **Input Validation:**
   - Validates user inputs to ensure data integrity and prevent errors during interactions.

7. **Dynamic Pricing:**
   - Calculates rental prices based on the car's daily rental rate and the specified rental duration.

**Concepts and Skills Demonstrated:**

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
  - Utilizes classes, objects, and encapsulation for modeling and organizing code.

- **List Data Structure:**
  - Uses `ArrayList` to dynamically store and manage lists of cars, customers, and rentals.

- **User Input Handling:**
  - Incorporates the `Scanner` class for user input, enhancing user interaction.

- **Conditional Statements and Loops:**
  - Implements loops and conditional statements for menu-driven interactions and decision-making.

- **Error Handling:**
  - Includes error handling mechanisms to manage invalid inputs and prevent runtime errors.

- **Code Modularity:**
  - Divides functionality into separate methods and classes for better maintainability and readability.

This project demonstrates strong Java programming skills, proficiency in OOP principles, and the ability to design and implement a console-based application for managing a car rental system.
